# Bookshelf
Bookshelf provides a convenient GUI to manage all your books. Sort books by preference, filter by genre, or simply view your backlog by filtering out books you've read. If you can't agree on the next book to read, let Bookshelf select a random book from the filtered list.

## Goal
Keeping a bookshelf organized can be a daunting task. Should you organize them by size or by series? Sometimes you want to buy a different edition or a hardcover version of a book and this can make things look awkward. Bookshelf solves this by allowing you to arbitrarily organize your physical bookshelf according to what looks best, and lets you sort and browse your books without causing chaos or having to clean up the mess.

## Installation
This section will be updated when the first release of Bookshelf is available.
